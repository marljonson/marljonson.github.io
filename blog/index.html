            General Mills: "You Are Here"
            <br>

            What can interns do to increase their chance of a full-time return offer?
            <br>
            ➤ You are measured via weekly check-ins with your manager. They will tell you why you are (not) on track to receiving a full-time offer.
            <br>
            ➤ Your manager will offer you a formal mentor outside of themself.
            <br>
            ➤ You will also get a "social buddy" who is 2–3 years older than you. Your social buddy will introduce you to other people.
            <br>
            ➤ Networking happens as much as you put yourself out there—it will return back to you.

            Product Management Club @ SJSU: "Sumeet Syal"
            <br>

            What can interns do to increase their chance of a full-time return offer?
            <br>
            ➤ Get over the fear that A.I. will replace your job. It's nothing but a tool that will complement your human intelligence.
            <br>
            ➤ If you network enough, you may never have to apply to jobs because of your network. That's how networking happens.
            <br>
            ➤ Take on projects you aren't assigned to. Start connecting with sales and marketing departments, if you're interested in them.
            <br>
            ➤ Is an MBA useful? Yes, it can expose you to otherwise imperceptible ideas—board meetings, bottlenecks, and corporate governments, to name a few.
            <br>
            ➤ How do you stand out against applicants with more technical experience? First, learn the inner workings of your own company's operations. Then, laterally move into the technical projects you want to be involved in. Ask others: "What are the other departments doing?"
            <br>
            ➤ The biggest thing that helps: quiet time in the morning. No podcast, phone, computer, or noise.
