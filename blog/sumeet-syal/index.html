            What can interns do to increase their chance of a full-time return offer?
            <br>
            ➤ Get over the fear that A.I. will replace your job. It's nothing but a tool that will complement your human intelligence.
            <br>
            ➤ If you network enough, you may never have to apply to jobs because of your network. That's how networking happens.
            <br>
            ➤ Take on projects you aren't assigned to. Start connecting with sales and marketing departments, if you're interested in them.
            <br>
            ➤ Is an MBA useful? Yes, it can expose you to otherwise imperceptible ideas—board meetings, bottlenecks, and corporate governance, to name a few.
            <br>
            ➤ How do you stand out against applicants with more technical experience? First, learn the inner workings of your own company's operations. Then, laterally move into the technical projects you want to be involved in. Ask others: "What are the other departments doing?"
            <br>
            ➤ The biggest thing that helps: quiet time in the morning. No podcast, phone, computer, or noise.
